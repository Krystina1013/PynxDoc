The only workable public full sharding blockchain
With high TPS: 64000 TPS on 1024 shards or 1M TPS on 16K shards
Using Low bandwith: Average 3Mbps for 1024 shards or 5Mbps on 16K shards!

we have built a testnet runs 64000 TPS on 1024 shards, you can test here by yourself!

# Core problems for sharding blockchain
## Safety For Shard
The power of shard is one factor of full network, consensus in shard should assure the safety to an acceptable level. 
## Bandwidth Explosion
In Beacon/Shard chain schema, the bandwidth is by the relation of O(N<sup>2</sup>),exploding on large-scale shards
## Rollback Storm
Rolling back block in one shard infects other relative shards, thus more others, resulting unstable network.

# Resolution by Pnyxchain


## proved safe in-shard consensus

6 aspects to match full-shard blockchain requirements:fairly incentive,safety,fast finalization and so on

## Transfer-On-Demand Storage
P2P Storage implements Transfer-On-Demand with active spreading system to reduce latency

## Low Bandwidth Requirement
3-Layered architecture reducing the bandwith to shards as O(N), only 3MBps on 1K shards and 5MBps on 16K shards

## Avoiding Rollback Storm
With fast and arithmatic finalization and processing cross-shard transactions after finalization, Rollback storm eliminated

# Performance

## High Safety
Proved consensus reducing prossiblity to 10<sup>-8</sup>， about once per 2500 years

## Low Bandwidth
low cross-shards comminucation requirement, runing 1K shards on 3MBps or 16K shards on 5MBps

## High TPS
62.5 Tps per shard, reached 64,000 on 1K shards and may reach 1M TPS on 16K shards.
